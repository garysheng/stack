Letta is a comprehensive platform for developing and deploying AI agents with persistent memory and advanced reasoning capabilities.

## Primary Use Cases

1. **Agent Development**
   - Memory management
   - State persistence
   - Tool integration
   - Reasoning systems

2. **Production Deployment**
   - Docker containers
   - Kubernetes scaling
   - PostgreSQL storage
   - API endpoints

3. **Development Tools**
   - Agent Development Environment (ADE)
   - Visual debugging
   - State inspection
   - Real-time editing

## Pro Tips

1. **Development Strategy**
   - Start with simple agents
   - Test memory persistence
   - Monitor resource usage
   - Use sandbox environments

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Configure memory limits
   - Optimize state storage
   - Handle context windows
   - Manage resources

3. **Best Practices**
   - Document agent states
   - Version control configs
   - Monitor interactions
   - Regular backups
