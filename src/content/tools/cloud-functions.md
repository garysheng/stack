description: "Serverless compute service I use for running asynchronous jobs like file processing and data vectorization"
howToUse: "- Write function code in supported language\n- Deploy function with desired trigger\n- Configure memory and timeout settings\n- Set up environment variables\n- Monitor function execution"
caveats: "- Cold start latency for infrequent calls\n- Maximum execution time limits\n- Need to handle function timeouts\n- Costs can scale with usage"

Cloud Functions is my serverless solution for running background tasks and processing jobs without managing infrastructure.

## Primary Use Cases

1. **Asynchronous Processing**
   - Vectorize messages and content
   - Convert file formats
   - Process uploaded media
   - Handle background tasks

2. **Event-Driven Operations**
   - Respond to database changes
   - Process pub/sub messages
   - Handle webhook requests
   - Schedule periodic tasks

3. **Integration Tasks**
   - Connect different services
   - Transform data formats
   - Trigger notifications
   - Sync data between systems

## Pro Tips

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Right-size memory allocation
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use connection pooling
   - Cache frequent operations

2. **Cost Management**
   - Monitor function execution time
   - Optimize cold starts
   - Use appropriate memory settings
   - Clean up unused functions

3. **Development Best Practices**
   - Use dependency injection
   - Implement proper logging
   - Handle retries gracefully
   - Test functions locally
