Galileo is an AI-powered design tool I\'m exploring for rapid UI prototyping and visual direction.

## Potential Uses

1. **Rapid Prototyping**
   - Quick UI mockups
   - Screen layouts
   - Design exploration
   - Visual brainstorming

2. **Design Direction**
   - Style experimentation
   - Layout options
   - Component visualization
   - Interface patterns

3. **Development Integration**
   - Design-to-code workflow
   - Component structure
   - Responsive layouts
   - Design system alignment

## Evaluation Areas

- Workflow integration
- Output quality
- Development handoff
- Time savings
- Learning curve
- Team collaboration
- Version control
- Design consistency
