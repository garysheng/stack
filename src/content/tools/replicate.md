Replicate makes it easy to integrate AI models into applications by providing a simple API interface to run thousands of open-source models in the cloud.

## Primary Use Cases

1. **Model Deployment**
   - Run models with one line of code
   - Auto-scaling infrastructure
   - Pay-per-compute billing
   - Multiple GPU options

2. **Fine-tuning**
   - Customize existing models
   - Train on your data
   - Create specialized versions
   - Deploy fine-tuned models

3. **Custom Models**
   - Deploy your own models
   - Use Cog for packaging
   - Automatic API generation
   - Production-ready scaling

## Pro Tips

1. **Development Strategy**
   - Test in playground first
   - Use appropriate GPU tiers
   - Monitor compute costs
   - Handle API timeouts

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Choose right model size
   - Batch requests when possible
   - Cache results
   - Use webhooks for long runs

3. **Best Practices**
   - Secure API tokens
   - Implement retry logic
   - Monitor usage metrics
   - Version control models
