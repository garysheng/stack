description: "Modern animation library for creating native app-like animations in React applications"
howToUse: "- Install via npm/yarn\n- Import motion components\n- Use animate prop for basic animations\n- Leverage variants for complex sequences\n- Implement gestures and scroll animations"
caveats: "- Performance impact with many animations\n- Complex animations need careful planning\n- Some features require Motion+\n- Spring animations need tuning"

Motion is my go-to animation library for creating fluid, native app-like animations in React applications with minimal effort.

## Primary Use Cases

1. **Component Animations**
   - Smooth transitions
   - Hover effects
   - Click animations
   - Page transitions

2. **Gesture Interactions**
   - Drag and drop
   - Pan gestures
   - Pinch to zoom
   - Touch interactions

3. **Scroll Effects**
   - Scroll-linked animations
   - Parallax effects
   - Scroll progress
   - Reveal on scroll

## Pro Tips

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use layout animations sparingly
   - Leverage hardware acceleration
   - Implement exit animations
   - Monitor frame rates

2. **Animation Design**
   - Use spring physics
   - Create reusable variants
   - Implement stagger effects
   - Chain animations properly

3. **Development Best Practices**
   - Keep animations subtle
   - Test on mobile devices
   - Use TypeScript for safety
   - Implement fallbacks
