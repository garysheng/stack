PNPM is my preferred Node.js package manager, offering significant advantages over npm and yarn through its innovative approach to dependency management.

## Primary Use Cases

1. **Dependency Management**
   - Hard linking for disk efficiency
   - Strict dependency checking
   - Monorepo management
   - Workspace orchestration

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Parallel installation
   - Content-addressable store
   - Efficient caching
   - Fast package resolution

3. **Project Management**
   - Workspace scripts
   - Dependency hoisting
   - Lock file management
   - Version management

## Pro Tips

1. **Disk Space Optimization**
   - Use store path efficiently
   - Clean unused packages
   - Manage global cache
   - Share dependencies

2. **Monorepo Management**
   - Configure workspaces
   - Use filters effectively
   - Share dependencies
   - Manage versions

3. **Best Practices**
   - Enable strict mode
   - Use lockfile
   - Configure .npmrc
   - Set up CI properly
