Spline is a powerful browser-based tool for creating interactive 3D experiences that can be easily integrated into web projects.

## Primary Use Cases

1. **3D Web Design**
   - Interactive scenes
   - Product showcases
   - Landing page elements
   - Animated illustrations

2. **Interactive Development**
   - User interactions
   - Motion design
   - Event handling
   - Physics simulations

3. **Web Integration**
   - React components
   - WebGL export
   - Performance optimization
   - Responsive design

## Pro Tips

1. **Design Strategy**
   - Start with simple shapes
   - Build complexity gradually
   - Test interactions early
   - Consider load times

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize geometry
   - Reduce polygon count
   - Compress textures
   - Manage scene complexity

3. **Best Practices**
   - Plan for mobile
   - Test across browsers
   - Consider fallbacks
   - Monitor frame rates
