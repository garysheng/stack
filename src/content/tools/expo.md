   - File-based routing
   - TypeScript support

2. **Cross-Platform Building**
   - iOS builds
   - Android builds
   - Web support
   - Single codebase

3. **Deployment & Updates**
   - EAS Build service
   - App store submissions
   - Over-the-air updates
   - Production monitoring

## Pro Tips

1. **Development Workflow**
   - Use development builds
   - Leverage hot reload
   - Configure prebuild
   - Test on real devices

2. **Build Optimization**
   - Manage dependencies
   - Configure app.json
   - Use EAS secrets
   - Optimize assets

3. **Production Best Practices**
   - Set up EAS Update
   - Configure build profiles
   - Use preview builds
   - Monitor metrics
