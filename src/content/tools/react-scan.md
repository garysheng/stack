React Scan is a specialized debugging tool that helps identify and resolve performance issues in React applications.

## Primary Use Cases

1. **Performance Analysis**
   - Detect slow renders
   - Find infinite loops
   - Track re-renders
   - Profile components

2. **Debug Optimization**
   - Component lifecycle issues
   - State management problems
   - Hook dependencies
   - Render bottlenecks

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Issue prioritization
   - Performance metrics
   - Optimization suggestions

## Pro Tips

1. **Debugging Strategy**
   - Focus on critical paths
   - Monitor key components
   - Track state changes
   - Analyze render trees

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Fix infinite loops
   - Reduce unnecessary renders
   - Optimize hooks usage
   - Implement memoization

3. **Best Practices**
   - Regular scanning
   - Baseline metrics
   - Document findings
   - Share optimizations
