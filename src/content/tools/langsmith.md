LangSmith is my essential tool for monitoring and debugging LLM applications, providing visibility into every step of the chain execution.

## Primary Use Cases

1. **LLM Operation Monitoring**
   - Track prompt executions
   - Monitor token usage
   - Analyze response quality
   - Debug chain failures

2. **Vector Search Tracing**
   - Track vector database queries
   - Monitor similarity scores
   - Analyze search results
   - Debug retrieval issues

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Measure latency metrics
   - Track cost and usage
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Optimize chain execution

## Pro Tips

1. **Debugging Optimization**
   - Use detailed tracing
   - Tag runs for organization
   - Monitor error patterns
   - Track edge cases

2. **Cost Management**
   - Monitor token usage
   - Track API calls
   - Set usage alerts
   - Optimize expensive operations

3. **Development Best Practices**
   - Use structured feedback
   - Implement proper logging
   - Version control prompts
   - Test chain components
